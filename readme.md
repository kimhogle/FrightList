This website includes lists of my (Kim Hogle) top favorite horror movies and horror shows of all time. Over the past 20 or so years, my love of the horror genre has grown so much and I thought I'd share my personal opinion on them while practicing the front-end web development skills I have recently learned. As a die hard horror fan, I figured this was a great chance to combine my new skills with one of my favorite hobbies. Enjoy, and feel free to share with me your opinions as well, using the e-mail link provided. Thanks to all and I hope you enjoy it.




The features I included in this project include:


CSS:
1) A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon.

2) Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner or menu animation.

Javascript:
1) Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information on your page somehow.

2) Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value to do something on the site. 

3) Create at least 3 variables (var, const, or let), set their values in JavaScript, and display the values somewhere on your page.
